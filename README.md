# EDA Ecommerce

#### Ecommerce Dataset for Data Analysis
About Dataset:
This dataset contains 55,000 entries of synthetic customer transactions, generated using Python's Faker library. The goal behind creating this dataset was to provide a resource for learners like myself to explore, analyze, and apply various data analysis techniques in a context that closely mimics real-world data.
- CID (Customer ID): A unique identifier for each customer.
- TID (Transaction ID): A unique identifier for each transaction.
- Gender: The gender of the customer, categorized as Male or Female.
- Age Group: Age group of the customer, divided into several ranges.
- Purchase Date: The timestamp of when the transaction took place.
- Product Category: The category of the product purchased, such as Electronics, Apparel, etc.
- Discount Availed: Indicates whether the customer availed any discount (Yes/No).
- Discount Name: Name of the discount applied (e.g., FESTIVE50).
- Discount Amount (INR): The amount of discount availed by the customer.
- Gross Amount: The total amount before applying any discount.
- Net Amount: The final amount after applying the discount.
- Purchase Method: The payment method used (e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, etc.).
- Location: The city where the purchase took place.

#### Use Cases:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This dataset is ideal for conducting EDA, allowing users to practice techniques such as summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns within the data.
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Learners can work on handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Use tools like Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI to visualize purchasing trends, customer demographics, or the impact of discounts on purchase amounts.
- Machine Learning Applications: After applying feature engineering, this dataset is suitable for supervised learning models, such as predicting whether a customer will avail a discount or forecasting purchase amounts based on the input features.
