## Key Insights from the Dataset
```1. Gender Distribution:```

The dataset is almost evenly split across genders. Female customers make up 33.3% of the total with 18,454 purchases, closely followed by Male customers at 32.6% with 18,096 purchases. A notable portion, 33.1%, identifies as Other, accounting for 18,450 purchases. This even distribution suggests that marketing strategies could equally target all genders to maximize outreach.

```2. Age Group Distribution:```

The 25-45 age group dominates the dataset, contributing to 41.8% of purchases (22,010 transactions). The 18-25 age group follows with 31.2% (16,431 purchases). Together, these two segments represent more than 70% of the customer base, indicating a significant focus on younger to middle-aged adults. Targeted marketing campaigns for these groups can significantly boost engagement. Additionally, the 45-60 group accounts for 21.1% (11,104), while the under 18 and 60 and above categories make up smaller shares at 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively.

```3. Product Category:```

Electronics is the most purchased product category, representing 29.3% of total sales (16,574 purchases). Clothing follows with 19.4% (10,968 purchases), and Beauty and Health ranks third with 14.7% (8,332 purchases). These top categories account for over 63% of all transactions, highlighting their popularity and potential for increased promotions. Categories like Toys & Games and Pet Care, with under 2% of sales each, present areas for possible growth or re-evaluation.

```4. Payment Methods:```

Credit Cards are the most popular payment method, used in 39.2% of purchases (22,096 transactions), followed by Debit Cards at 24.5% (13,809 transactions). Other digital methods such as Net Banking (9.7%), and UPI platforms like PhonePe and Paytm each represent around 5% of transactions. These insights suggest a strong preference for electronic and card-based payments, underlining the importance of optimizing digital payment infrastructures.

```5. Location Distribution:```

The highest number of purchases come from Mumbai (11,197), Delhi (10,799), and Bangalore (8,249), which together account for 52% of all transactions. These cities serve as key urban markets. However, regions like Varanasi (606 purchases), Dehradun (553), and Srinagar (548), which contribute less than 2% of total sales each, represent potential areas for growth or outreach.

```6. Purchase Trends Over Time:```

The line plot reveals that the number of purchases stays relatively stable between 900-950 per month from 2020 to 2024, with a few seasonal peaks and dips. Notable spikes are seen around the end of each year, likely due to holiday sales, while thereâ€™s a sharp decline towards the end of 2024, potentially signaling either incomplete data or a significant drop in sales. This trend can inform inventory planning and promotional scheduling for peak and off-peak times.
